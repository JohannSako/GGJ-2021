# GGJ-2021
2021 Global Game Jam repository

This project was made in collaboration with Marco Reguillot from Epitech and Axel Wakhevitsch from Eartsup.

This is a pygame game on the "lost and found" theme, the theme of the 2021 Global Game Jam.

## How to use ?
Execute the file "game.py" with an IDE or from a terminal. If errors occur make sure you have python installed, open python from the command prompt and make sure pygame and numpy are both installed too.
